### RWD App in NodeJS and AngularJS

This is Responsive Website in Node.js with Express, EJS and Stylus. A good basis for building larger solutions, eg CMS systems.

The template combines the frontend with the backend in JavaScript.

#### Backend

The server works on NodeJS and builds the application via gulp. Gulp helps to automate painful or time-consuming tasks in the workflow of development.

The basic commands are enough to prepare compressed js and css files productively:

```
gulp build
node app.js
```
You can enable the listening task
```
gulp watch
```
or build a development version
```
gulp dev
```
#### Frontend

On the frontend side, we use AngularJS for routing and Motion UI for animation. Motion UI is a JS library for quickly creating CSS transitions and animations.

I designed the original user interface basing on the Frameworks CSS Zurb Foundation.

Foundation is a family of responsive front-end frameworks that make it easy to design beautiful responsive websites, apps and emails that look amazing on any device. Foundation is semantic, readable, flexible, and completely customizable.
