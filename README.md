**Responsive Website at Node.js with Motion UI and Stylus. Template for building larger solutions, e.g. CMS, CRM in JavaScript.**

### Backend

- NodeJS
- Express
- Nodemailer
- Morgan
- Gulp

We build the application via gulp. Gulp helps to automate painful or time-consuming tasks in the workflow of development.

The basic commands are enough to prepare compressed js and css files productively:

```
gulp build
node app.js
```
You can enable the listening task
```
gulp watch
```
or build a development version
```
gulp dev
```
### Frontend

- AngularJS
- Motion UI
- Lodash
- EJS

On the frontend side, we use AngularJS for routing and Motion UI for animation. Motion UI is a JS library for quickly creating CSS transitions and animations.

### UI

- Foundation CSS
- Stylus
- CSS3



I designed the original user interface basing on the Frameworks CSS Zurb Foundation. Foundation is a family of responsive front-end frameworks that make it easy to design beautiful responsive websites, apps and emails that look amazing on any device. Foundation is semantic, readable, flexible, and completely customizable.
