Responsive and cached website at Node.js, Express with Motion UI and Stylus. A good template for building larger solutions, such as CMS, CRM entirely in JavaScript.

### Installation

**NPM (server-side)**

```nodejs
npm install
node app.js
```
We build the application via gulp. 

> Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.

>**Source:** [gulpjs.com](https://https://gulpjs.com/)

###### The basic commands are enough to prepare compressed js and css files:

```gulp
gulp build
```
###### You can enable the listening task
```gulp
gulp watch
```
###### or build a development version
```gulp
gulp dev
```

### User Interface

- Responsive web design (RWD) 
- CSS Foundation
- Stylus

I designed the original user interface basing on the CSS Frameworks Zurb Foundation.
